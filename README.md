# `lofi.co` but Open Source

> [!IMPORTANT]
> My instance `https://lofi-co-assets.vexcited.com` got shutdown lately (because of a migration I am doing) so the assets won't be available for some moment, sorry for this inconvenience. See the FAQ if you want to host yourself the assets.

## FAQ

### Why ?

I love the design of `lofi.co` and I want to keep it alive even after it shuts down.

### What's not included ?

- LofiAI

...and maybe even more things but I don't know yet.

### What about assets ?

Since `lofi.co` will shut down, their assets at `https://lofico.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com` will probably also shut down - not sure about that though.

To prevent losing any of those assets, I've dumped and mirrored them at `https://lofi-co-assets.vexcited.com`. You can spin up your own assets mirror by serving these dumps from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZBbENPYxs5mXB-1SIU-ftNBx9opRhhNl). Each `.zip` file is a folder, you can use the [directory listing of my mirror](https://lofi-co-assets.vexcited.com) as reference.
